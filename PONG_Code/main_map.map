WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   U3/reset_start_button_OR_1462_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   297 out of   1,430   20%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       152 out of   2,860    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          834

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              18 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
